**Number of Players:** 1-4  
Players will take turns rolling to see who gets to go first.

**How to Play:**
You play the game by rolling a die and adding the number that is rolled to your points. But be careful, rolling a 1 will result in losing all your points! Ending your turn will save any points you accumulated and the next player will get to roll. First player to get to 100 point wins!

**Meet Hugo**
Hugo is a bot that you can play against for a single player experience. Hugo's behavior changes depending on who's ahead. If Hugo is falling behind, he'll take a bit more risk in his rolls and play more conservative when ahead.
